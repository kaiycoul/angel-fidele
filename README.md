ANGEL, FIDELE

 What appears to be a mated pair of animals changes shape into

 two celestials. Their humanoid forms still bear some marks of

 their animal selves. They move in perfect harmony.

 Fidele angels form from souls so devoted to each other

 that their love transcends death.

 FRIENDS TO LOVERS. Fideles are charged with exhorting mortals to respect the bonds of partnership. They assist lovers facing obstacles and punish the enemies of love. Where there is a conflict between two cultures' laws

 in love, they prefer the result that keeps the beloved together.

 QUIET DIPLOMATS. They prefer diplomacy to force and, despite

 the urgency of love, they've been known to live secretly among mortals for years or decades while waging quiet campaigns against social mores and cultural norms that keep love from

 achieving its full potential.

 RAGE OF PASSION. When love is denied, or when kept apart, fidele angels can enter towering rages and an anger born of passionate righteousness.
